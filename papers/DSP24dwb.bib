abstract = {As wireless communication rapidly evolves and the demand for intelligent connectivity grows, the need for precise sensing integrated with efficient communication becomes paramount. While traditional Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) methods have laid foundational groundwork, they grapple with environmental limitations and significant propagation losses. Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as a transformative solution characterized by its high-speed transmission, minimal latency, cost-efficiency, and seamless installation. This paper introduces the Lighting, Sensing, and Communication (LiSAC) concept for VLC and systematically reviews the technical aspects, such as channel characteristics, modulation techniques, and system design. Specifically, this paper presents the evolution of the LiSAC system, its integration with other communication technologies, its applications in various fields, and its challenges. At the end of this paper, we outlooked LiSAC in the future, in which high-quality communication will integrate pinpoint sensing accuracy.}
