  abstract={The clipping noise, which could cause out-of-band radiation and increase bit error rate in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems, is necessary to be mitigated. This paper proposes a clipping noise elimination scheme based on compressed sensing (CS) with partially aware support. Specifically, the clipping noise is reconstructed from the selected reliable observations in the frequency domain with the proposed partially aware support sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm. The proposed method outperforms the conventional clipping noise elimination approaches in the aspects of both the accuracy and robustness by exploiting the partially aware support, which is verified by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation.},
